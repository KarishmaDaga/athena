↪ [fastcore: an underrated python library](https://fastpages.fast.ai/fastcore/)

Really interesting read about advanced techniques for using python: introspection, type dispatch, decorators, and utilities inspired by other languages. 

↪ [pycon 2016: memory management in python, nina zakharenko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6u5rhUQ6dU)

Probably my favourite explanation of the basics of garbage collection in Python. Nina goes over reference counting, garbage collection, weakreferences, '__slots__' and more.

Hey! I'm Karishma, a software engineer with an interest in all sorts of technology, particularly in open-source, Python, and real-time collaboration. I've worked on [open-source machine learning platforms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-mlflow#train-with-mlflow-projects), user-experience, and commerce tools at Microsoft. 

Now, I'm building an open-source library for spinning up propositional logic encodings on the fly under the supervision of [Professor Christian Muise](http://haz.ca/) at the [Mu Lab](http://mulab.ai/) for my senior year project.

In my spare time, you can find me curating spotify playlists, reading, eating out with friends, listening to history podcasts, and exploring cities on foot.

Always down to chat! Feel free to reach me at [karishdaga@gmail.com](mailto:karishdaga@gmail.com) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/karishmadagaa).
